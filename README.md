# Seamus Cahill — Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio!  
This repository showcases my hands-on work in network analysis, security auditing, vulnerability assessment, and system administration. Each folder contains project documentation, analysis reports, and reflections from the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.


## Repository Overview

### 01_Vulnerability_Assessment
**File:** `Vulnerability_Assessment_Report.docx`  
Performed a full vulnerability and risk analysis of an e-commerce database server. Applied NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 to assess threats and recommend mitigations such as least privilege, MFA, and IDS/IPS integration.

### 02_Botium_Toys_Audit
**Files:** `Botium-Toys-Scope-goals-and-risk-assessment-report.docx`, `Control-categories.docx`, `Controls-and-coompliance-checklist.docx`  
Completed a mock security audit for Botium Toys using NIST CSF. Identified missing administrative, technical, and physical controls; created compliance checklist recommendations for PCI DSS and GDPR.

### 03_Incident_Reports

####  Incident Report Analysis  
**File:** `Incident_Report_Analysis.docx`  
Analyzed a DDoS attack scenario affecting a multimedia company. Applied the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover from the event. Strengthened understanding of firewall rules, network monitoring, and incident response procedures.

####  Incident Handler’s Journal  
**File:** `Incident_Handler_Journal.docx`  
Documented multiple SOC-style exercises including phishing investigations, ransomware responses, and network packet analysis using Wireshark and tcpdump. Demonstrated analytical thinking, tool proficiency, and incident documentation best practices.

### 04_Technical_Labs
**Files:**  
- `Using_Linux_Commands_to_Manage_File_Permissions.docx` – Applied Linux permissions management with `ls -la` and `chmod`.  
- `Algorithm_for_File_Updates_in_Python.docx` – Developed a Python script to reconcile IP address lists.  
- `Applying_Filters_to_SQL_Queries.docx` – Used SQL filters and operators (AND, OR, NOT, LIKE) to refine database queries.
